#
# Works from a computer with adb, or from the TV itself with Termux. It only ever Installs an APK and (with --home)
# changes which app is HOME - nothing else, so nothing here needs root.
#
#   --apk PATH     install this APK instead of the latest release
#   --home         also make Glass the home screen (stronger, reversible; see the note at the end)
#   --permissions  also grant the optional one-time permissions (screensaver, recents, Wi-Fi name, Sonos)
#   --yes          no prompts
#   --uninstall    remove Glass and restore the stock launcher
#
# Nothing is destructive by default: without --home the stock launcher is left alone, so you can try Glass first.
