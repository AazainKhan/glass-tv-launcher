/**
 * How Glass keeps its remote-keys accessibility service (remote app buttons, Recent Apps, instant Back) on, per install
 * way (P93). Pure, so the decision is unit-tested; [KeysService] gathers the inputs and carries the action out.
 *
 *  - APK, no root: Glass can't enable a service itself. It asks once, with a Home card that opens Fire's Accessibility
 *    settings, and never calls su.
 *  - Glass Pro (rooted) or Glass OS: it keeps the service enabled while the setting is on.
 *  - Any install with WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS granted (adb): the same, through the Settings provider (no su).
